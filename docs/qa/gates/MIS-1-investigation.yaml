verdictHistory: "CONCERNS -> PASS (O1/O2 factual inaccuracies resolved by @architect)"

summary: >
  Investigation story of exceptional depth — 10 repos analyzed with code-level detail,
  14 Claude Code hooks mapped, 4-layer architecture designed with 9 ADRs.
  Anti-hallucination verification found 2 factual inaccuracies (MEDIUM), both resolved:
  O1) context-manager.js reclassified from dead code to "Active but Underutilized" (2 consumers),
  O2) gotchas-memory.js documented with correct 4 consumers (added ideation-engine.js).
  All 12 ACs fully met. No code changes. Quality verified.
